Welcome! This is a small to do list app created using React Native (using Expo framework).

To get started, please follow the guide to setup Expo [here](https://docs.expo.dev/). 

The app was primarily tested on Android. The app still runs on iOS, it just looks a tiny bit misshapen due to the way Apple applies styles slightly differently.
